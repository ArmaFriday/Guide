Operation Warlord
=================================================

Operation Warlord is a follow-up campaign of Operation Dessert Storm. The main premise is that the ArmaFriday platoon was brought to Tanoa due to increased shipping from Russia. Worried about destabilization in the area just like on Altis, a spy plane was sent in to investigate the area.

Operation Dessert Storm
=================================================

Operation Dessert Storm was the first ArmaFriday campaign cycle of 2017. Its premise was that Altis was destabalized by a rebel force called "Altis Liberation Front" (ALF). We later learned there was Russian involvement and together with Altis' democratically elected government Altis was liberated over the course of 7 major missions.
