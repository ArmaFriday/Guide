Mission Details
=================================================

Move out from Georgetown and assault a sugar factory to the east which is believed to be used by the Russians to develop chemical weapons on Tanoa Island.


Execution..
"""""""""""""""""
After helicopter landing south of Georgetown we moved east under the cover of darkness. First enemy contact happened near a bridge

Team Retrospective
=================================================

What went well
"""""""""""""""""

* The entire mission went well. Good communication within the squads, added a couple helpful piecies of advice.
* Had a lot of work (Medic) todo but still got off plenty of shots, so that was fun.
* Overall team communication an cohesiveness was great. We spotted enemies very well and dealt with them as a team.
* As a fire team, we moved and coordinated effectively. Coverage was good and I always felt I had my fire team's back or they had mine.  On the squad level, I feel movement and action was efficient and decisive.


What went wrong
"""""""""""""""""

* Just the server crash but its not controlable.
* May have thrown a grenade that white Alpha 1. (I think it was me at least). After the crash I didn't reset my grenade choice. Maybe they could always default to smoke?
* Alpha 2 FT got "lost" a couple times and had to double back (that was on me as lead). We (either FireTeam) sometimes moved up *too* quickly, which lead to being nearly overrun from flanks.
* I felt as a DM, I wasn't put in the best position to perform my role many times. I was treated as a rifleman and asked to clear buildings, assault, etc. Second point: Many times throughout the night the fire teams felt like separate squads and not two fire teams of one squad. I think unless we are bounding or taking separate actions during an assault, we should be moving as one unit under the direction of the squad leader able to cover each other.

What we could do differently to improve
"""""""""""""""""

* Switch up roles within the people that have been awhile
* A1 & A2 needed more cross communication. Seemed to be doing their own thing until the SL gave specific instruction.
* Personally: More confidence in my commands, more observing my team and less physically leading it. As a team: Stick in our roles (DM, MG, Ast. MG, etc). Make sure that we're doing what WE as a member need to do, even if it's boring at the moment.
* Forgot to add a few points in my previous submission. I still feel separate fire team radio channels is not necessary and serves to separate the fire teams. That being said, communication on the squad channel should be reserves to information the entire squad needs. (enemy call outs, squad and fire team updates, etc.). It shouldn't be used for fire team members to indicate when they're moving,  providing updates to other fire team members, etc. which I heard quite a bit of last night. Movement at the fire team level I feel could use some work. There might be a touch of micromanaging by the FTL's. Although this could be alleviated by the fire team members as well by not relying on the FTL's to tell them exactly where to go and what position to take. As an example, the SAW and DM if there is one should take it upon himself to get into a position where he can cover the fire team/squad when the unit is stopped.

Feedback on the Designated Marksman role
"""""""""""""""""
If we are going to move forward using a DM with a sniper load out, the role should be treated as a sniper and not be attached to a fire team and instead be part of squad support. Personally, I feel the DM (or sniper) role is not needed for most if not all our work in arma. We tend to be always moving and moving at an aggressive pace at that which renders the DM ineffective. A sniper, or DM's main role should be over-watch and killing high value targets. We are never in one position long enough for over-watch on that level to be really needed and very rarely, do we come across "high value" targets: mg's, enemy support teams, etc.
