Mission Details
=================================================

Last week's "Operation Blacksheep" saw us exfiltrate a NATO pilot from Tavu, a village on Belavu island under the control of a local warlord called "Johny".

In the days following, Johny has been increasing his raids on the Tuvanakan people, his claim beeing that the Tuvanakan people have provoked the Belavu tribe by "using NATO dogs" to further their own goals. Nothing is further from the truth however as Blacksheep had originally crash-landed on the Tuvanakan island and it was in fact Johny who had captured the pilot "Blacksheep" and brought him to one of his own islands, which triggered the NATO response.

As a concequence of this chain-of-events, the NATO friendly Tuvanakan people are outraged at the increased raids and blame NATO directly for causing them. Under threat of them ending the agreement for NATO to have an airbase on their sovereign island of Tuvanaka, NATO has agreed to help stabilize the threat to their people.

Deaf to all diplomatic attempts to work out an arrangement, Johny has made his intentions clear to ignore NATO's desire for peace and continues to raid the Tuvanakans.

The ArmaFriday platoon is to be deployed to invade Belavu island and curb Johny's offensive capabilities. We are to return to Tavu where blacksheep was beeing held and neutralize all of Johny's forces, as well as capture the bridge connecting Belavu island to Katkoula island. Command believes that denying Johny of this bridge will greatly affect his supply chain.

**Phase 1: Northern Belavu**

We took a Mark V Special Operations Craft (boat) and returned to Tavu under the cover of darkness. About 300 meters off the coast we could already spot patrols off of the coast line east of Muaceba in the old ferry docks. We opened fire and secured a landing site to the south east.
We then continued our advance through the woods and encounted one or two fireteams on the coast and in the woods.

Our assault on Muaceba began right before daybreak. We encountered multiple fireteams and support from the forest to the south west of it.
We called in helicopter air support to surpress the enemy in the forest. Muaceba was secured at 9.30 AM.

We encountred very little resistance towards Tavu. Just one or two fireteams who were advancing on Muaceba to support it in vain.

The assault on Tavu went well for the most part. Alpha-Two took heavy casualties on the North of Tavu.

**Phase 2: Combat patrol**

We continued inland using a squad staggered column and advanced south. We encountered a single fireteam patrol.
We encountered another two fireteams further to the south who were guarding a hemp field and captured two vehicles which we used to transport the squad to Rautake

**Phase 3: Advance on Bridge**

Alpha squad used a bounding movement to advance along the main road south east towards the bridge. We encountered multiple fireteams holding up in various buildings and we countered two separate flanking maneuvers. One from the East and another from the West. The heaviest resistance took place in the perimeter of the forest covering the base of the bridge. Alpha-One took heavy casualties.
The bridge was secured and Russians troops were observed guarding the base of the bridge on Katkoula island to the south of Balavu. Including a Russian Armered Personal Carrier BTR-90.
