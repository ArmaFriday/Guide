Mission Details
=================================================

Last week's operation "Bridge over troubled water" saw us return to Belavu island for a significant attack on Johny's forces in an attempt to curb his offensive capabilities, diminish his capacity for raiding the Tavunakan people and force johny's hand into diplomacy for peace. Part of our objective was to secure "Belavu Bridge", the only reliable infrastructure connecting Belavu Island to Katkoula Island. What we found on the other side were Russians.

Upon returning to base we have since learned what the Russian angle is. Frethen was watching his favourite TV show when it was interrupted by "breaking news"; a press conference by Russian President Boris Sokolov announcing Russian deployment to the Island of Belavu "to ensure stability in the area and guarantee the fair treatment of the Belavu people". Apple sauce for sure.

There was no way


Execution..

**Phase 1: Northern Belavu**

We took a Mark V Special Operations Craft (boat) and returned to Tavu under the cover of darkness. About 300 meters off the coast we could already spot patrols off of the coast line east of Muaceba in the old ferry docks. We opened fire and secured a landing site to the south east.
We then continued our advance through the woods and encounted one or two fireteams on the coast and in the woods.

Our assault on Muaceba began right before daybreak. We encountered multiple fireteams and support from the forest to the south west of it.
We called in helicopter air support to surpress the enemy in the forest. Muaceba was secured at 9.30 AM.

We encountred very little resistance towards Tavu. Just one or two fireteams who were advancing on Muaceba to support it in vain.

The assault on Tavu went well for the most part. Alpha-Two took heavy casualties on the North of Tavu.

**Phase 2: Combat patrol**

We continued inland using a squad staggered column and advanced south. We encountered a single fireteam patrol.
We encountered another two fireteams further to the south who were guarding a hemp field and captured two vehicles which we used to transport the squad to Rautake

**Phase 3: Advance on Bridge**

Alpha squad used a bounding movement to advance along the main road south east towards the bridge. We encountered multiple fireteams holding up in various buildings and we countered two separate flanking maneuvers. One from the East and another from the West. The heaviest resistance took place in the perimeter of the forest covering the base of the bridge. Alpha-One took heavy casualties.
The bridge was secured and Russians troops were observed guarding the base of the bridge on Katkoula island to the south of Balavu. Including a Russian Armered Personal Carrier BTR-90.
