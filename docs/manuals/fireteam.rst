The Fireteam
=========================================================================

A fireteam at ArmaFriday is made up of 4 to 5 men. The roles that are within a fireteam may vary depending on the scope of the mission and the # of signups. But ideally a fireteam is either focussed on a Light Machine Gunner or an Anti-Tank role.
