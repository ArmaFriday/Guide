Roles at ArmaFriday
=========================================================================

In a typical ArmaFriday game, we coordinate two fireteams or more towards common objectives. Teamwork is at the forefront and as such we balance the loadouts of the players in a way that encourages the most amount of teamplay and close-range combat.


=================================================
The Rifleman
=================================================

Everyone at ArmaFriday is a rifleman **first and foremost** regardless of role. The rifleman is at the core of our combat strength. Various roles perform various functions, but we are only as strong as our weakest link. And our goal is to turn our weakest links into great players. To this end, every player must be familiar with the core tenets of what makes a good rifleman.

**Teamwork**
ArmaFriday is about playing as a team. A single rifleman acting on his own is not nearly as effective as a cohesive fireteam of four or five players. You must look out for your team members and they will look out for you. Together you will form the vanguard of our platoon.

Listen to your fireteam leader. And when in doubt, as him for clarifications on:
* What vector you should be covering.
* Where you should be at in the formation, if a formation is applied.

As a rifleman, your core responsabilities are:
* **Maintaining appropriate distance from your team members: ** Don't bundle up closely together with your fireteam. Keep appropriate distance in the formation to avoid unnecessary casualties from Anti-Personal mines or grenades.



=================================================
Weapons "Hold"
=================================================
This could also be referred to as "Go Quiet" or "Stealth Mode". Here our intention is to refrain from engaging in firefights. We are focussed primarily on maneuvering quietly or efficiently.

* You should only return fire **if the threat is imminent**: if the enemy is at 500 meters and their fire is ineffective, refrain from getting bogged down in a firefight and focus on maneuvering out of harms way or towards the objective.
* If the enemy's fire is effective, achieve fire superiority first and then return to weapons hold mode.
* Focus on stealth and conceilment: be concious about how visible you are to the enemy.

=================================================
Weapons "Tight"
=================================================
Most commonly called when multiple fireteams are in an urban setting and in a situation where they might mistake one another for the enemy.

* It is critical you identify your target as an enemy, and a threat.
* Even if an enemy is identified, make sure they are not surrendering.

=================================================
Weapons "Free"
=================================================
Most commonly called when things are about to, or have heated up. Generally the universal "ROE" applies but:

* You are free to open fire on everything you have reason to believe is an enemy threat
