Roles at ArmaFriday
=========================================================================

In a typical ArmaFriday game, we coordinate two fireteams or more towards common objectives. Teamwork is at the forefront and as such we balance the loadouts of the players in a way that encourages the most amount of teamplay and close-range combat.


=================================================
The Rifleman
=================================================

Everyone at ArmaFriday is a rifleman **first and foremost** regardless of role. The rifleman is at the core of our combat strength. Various roles perform various functions, but we are only as strong as our weakest link. And our goal is to turn our weakest links into great players. To this end, every player must be familiar with the core tenets of what makes a good rifleman.

**Teamwork**

ArmaFriday is about playing as a team. A single rifleman acting on his own is not nearly as effective as a cohesive fireteam of four or five players. You must look out for your team members and they will look out for you. Together you will form the vanguard of our platoon.

Listen to your fireteam leader. And when in doubt, as him for clarifications on:

* What vector you should be covering.
* Where you should be at in the formation, if a formation is applied.

As a rifleman, your core responsabilities are:

* Maintaining appropriate distance from your team members: Don't bundle up closely together with your fireteam. Keep appropriate distance in the formation to avoid unnecessary casualties from Anti-Personal mines or grenades.
* Practice fire dicipline and know the Rules of Engagement (ROE)
* Maintain situational awareness. Try and keep your head cool during the fight.
